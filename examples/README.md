# Examples
> Examples to show how to compute and visualize density estimates 
> using functions in `dekef`. 

For computing and visualizing density estimates in the 1-dimensional 
setting, please refer to the Jupyter notebook 
`density_estimation_1d_geyser.ipynb`.

More Jupyter notebooks are in preparation.
